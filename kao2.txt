	It's no exaggeration to say that people are easily influenced by media. That is, whenever a new tourist spot or a new restaurant opens, or when a new product releases, there usually will be crowds of people forming a long line just to experience it, most of whom are likely influenced by various media. Take the craze of a certain milk tea brand for instance. A few years ago, a new brand of milk tea was released, but it's only sold in a certain store. Due to its exclusivity, many flocked to those certain stores just to even get a chance at buying one of these. As the reports of this craze started spreading through media, it attracts more people's attention, thus making lines longer. This will then get more attraction via media, causing a cycle until it eventually dies down.

	In my opinion however, this kind of activity isn't something I appreciate, mostly because of just how pointless it is. Even if a certain thing attracts lots of attention, it will never satisfy everyone, and there's going to be people feeling disappointed after long waiting. And to avoid that disappointment, many people will come up with excuses to justify the waiting. If so, why can't people be more cautious with such things? By thinking carefully before jumping into such things, we would better understand if joining on this craze is truly worth it or not. Especially in this modern society, evaluating such decisions is something we all need to do before blindly following it.
