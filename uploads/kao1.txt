	It never occurred to me that bullying could happen near me, and I'd never had the courage to help stop these actions. During one afternoon, when I was just minding my own business, I saw one of my classmates being picked on by some other classmates who were constantly disruptive. Despite my mind telling me to step in and try to stop them, my lack of courage ended up making me witness this whole act without taking any action. Moments later during a composition test, when I was writing my ideas out, I heard a faint sobbing sound coming from nearby. I quickly recognized that the sounds were coming from that classmate who was being teased earlier, and from what I saw, he was quietly crying as he wrote, desperately trying not to attract any attention.

	The bullied classmate transferred to another school a week later, and seldom had I heard about him afterwards. However, the faint sound of his cries has been forever etched into my mind, making it the most vivid and regrettable sound in my memory. I knew that if I had stepped in and stopped those acts of teasing, it would probably be less likely that he would transfer to another school. And given that I was one of the few people that actually treated him normally, what I ended up doing at that time felt like an act of betrayal to him. This all could have changed if I had had the courage to step in, but peer pressure got the best of me and made me make a choice that I have regretted to this day. The faint cries turned into a personal reminder for me, and anytime when someone is being teased, these sounds always remind me that I should stand up for those in need, and prevent another tragedy from happening.
